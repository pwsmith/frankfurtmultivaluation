The sub-project on coordination has two foci, both centered around the observation that whilst agreement in conjunctions often reflects the sum of the conjuncts involved (*a boy and a girl **are** walking*), agreement in disjunctions typically only reflects one of the disjuncts (*a boy or a girl **is** walking*).

This is a robust pattern that repeats itself across many languages.
Put another way, conjunction  quite often involves agreement resolution whereas disjunction does not.

However, there are cases where resolved agreement is found in disjunction, both typologically, as well as under certain semantic conditions, such as negation (*neither...nor* constructions), and in contexts of inclusive disjunction.

The subproject on coordination then has two aims.
 - To test the crosslinguistic robustness of the observation that conjunction involves resolved agreement but disjunction does not.
 - To identify and test semantic influences that increase resolved agreement in disjunctions.

Please see the links to the left for our database and our language reports on the behaviour of coordination in various languages.
This part is constantly under construction, as we add new languages.
