This sub-project looks into cases where one element receives multiple feature values, i.e. multi-valuation. 

In the nominal domain, multi-valuation is seen in the Nominal Right Node Raising construction in (1). In (1) _student(s)_ is shared by two DPs and it receives one singular value from each DP. In English, the pivot noun must be spelled out as singular, while in languages like Russian, it can be spelled out as plural.

(1) 
a. This tall and that short **_student_** are a couple.

b. \*This tall and that short **_students_** are a couple.

In the verbal domain, multi-valuation is seen in the TP Right Node Raising construction in (2) (Grosz 2015). In (2) the shared auxiliary _has/have_ agrees with both embedded subjects _Mary_ and _Sue_. In English, the shared auxiliary can be either singular or plural. But in Languages like Slovenian, the shared auxiliary must be singular. 

(2) John is happy that Mary, and Bill is glad that Sue, **_has/have_** been to Cameroon.

A cross-linguistic survey of 18 languages reveals a typological gap: no language that show singular agreement on shared auxiliary in (2) show plural agreement on the shared noun in (1).

In this sub-project we will 
1. extend the empirical scope of the investigation of multi-valuation in terms of languages;
2. investigate the connection between multi-valuation and the similar pattern labelledas the Agreement Hierarchy in agreement with hybrid nouns (Corbett 1979, 2006);
3. look into both **matching** and **mismatching** cases of multi-valuation using experimental methods.
