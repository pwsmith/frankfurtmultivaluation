## Agreement in Multivaluation Constructions

### Description:

As part of the DFG-funded project 'A General Theory of Multivaluation', the Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main will host a workshop 'Agreement in Multivaluation Constructions' on 19-20 November 2020. The project aims to investigate how agreement is determined when there is not a unique controller of agreement, and so the target of agreement obtains features from multiple sources.

### Invited Speakers:
- [Barbara Citko](http://faculty.washington.edu/bcitko/) (University of Washington)
- [Paula Fenger](https://sites.google.com/view/paulafenger) (University of Connecticut/Harvard University)
- [Caroline Heycock](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~heycock/) (University of Edinburgh)
- [Franc Marušič](http://www.ung.si/~fmarusic/pub/index.html) (University of Nova Gorica)
- [Alan Munn](https://msu.edu/~amunn/) (Michigan State University)
- [Jana Willer-Gold](https://sites.google.com/site/willergoldjana/) (University College London)

### Important dates:

- ***Deadline for abstract submission: May 15, 2020***
- Notification of acceptance: by June 30, 2020
- Workshop: November 19-20, 2020

## Call for Papers:

We invite submissions for oral presentations (25 minute talk +10 minutes
discussion) related to multivaluation constructions. Talks which investigate
the following topics are particularly encouraged:
1. Cross-linguistic differences in agreement patterns with disjoined and
conjoined subjects, and the structure of coordinations.
2. Cross-linguistic differences in agreement patterns in Right Node Raising
and other constructions with multiple subjects.
3. How feature conflicts in case of multivaluation are resolved (for instance
''he or I {are/am/is} on the way'') and effects of syncretism.
4. Patterns of closest conjunct and highest conjunct agreement, and how they
impact on the formulation of the mechanism of agreement.
5. Agreement patterns related to the Agreement Hierarchy of Corbett (1979, et
seq.), and how the Agreement Hierarchy can be modeled.
6. Experimental work on agreement patterns in multivation constructions.

 ***Submission guidelines:***

Abstracts should be at most two pages long, including all data and references,
on letter-size / A4 paper with 1-inch margins on all sides, and must be set in
Times New Roman font of at least 11 points. Submissions are limited to at most
one single-authored submission and at most one joint-authored submission per
author.

Please submit anonymized abstracts electronically in PDF format through the
[EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=amc2020) system by ***May 15, 2020***.
