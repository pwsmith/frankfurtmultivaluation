We have uploaded our first batch of language files for the coordination project.
One of our aims is to build a freely accessible repository of coordination strategies across languages, and so far we have collected data from 122 languages.
These files can be found at the [coordination](/coordination) page where they are collected by language family.
The data are drawn from reference grammars of the languages and represents all the information on coordination in that grammar that we could find.

The database itself is still quite rudimentary right now and we aim to develop the infrastructure, and how things are organised quite extensively as we proceed.
Right now, you are able to download a pdf with some basic overview of the language, information about verbal agreement, any conjunction data that we have available for this language, any disjunction data that we have available for this language, and data about the adposition system in the language.
Note that this is quite `raw' data: it is just taken from the grammatical description without much comment or context.
We will shortly develop this aspect.

More data is being collected and will be posted when available.
We do encourage anyone to contribute to our data collection if possible!
If you speak, or are familiar with a language that we don't have, or can contribute missing data from existing files, we would greatly appreciate your help, and please get in touch with [Pete](mailto:p.smith@em.uni-frankfurt.de).
