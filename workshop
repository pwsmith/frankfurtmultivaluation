As part of the DFG-funded project 'A General Theory of Multivaluation', the
Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main will host a workshop 'Agreement in
Multivaluation Constructions' on 19-20 November 2020. The project aims to
investigate how agreement is determined when there is not a unique controller
of agreement, and so the target of agreement obtains features from multiple
sources.

Invited Speakers:
- Barbara Citko (University of Washington)
- Paula Fenger (University of Connecticut/Harvard University)
- Caroline Heycock (University of Edinburgh)
- Franc Marušič (University of Nova Gorica)
- Alan Munn (Michigan State University)
